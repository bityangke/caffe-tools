# (py)caffe tools

Random tools for [Caffe] and pycaffe.

* `initialization` contains scripts aiding with network training bootstrapping
* `visualization` contains scripts that help with visualization of training losses, layers, etc.

Note that some of these scripts utilize third-party code cherry-picked from other repositories. This should be noted in the script files.
